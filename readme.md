### Unified bubble theory
#### 1. Purpose
This is the fortran code for the unified bubble theory which is used to simulate
bubble dynamics in different circumstances. 

#### 2. Usage
The code is written with modern fortran. Thus, a fortran compiler is required.
On windows, the visual studio is used as the IDE. 
On linux, it can be compiled with make ultility.

#### 3. Contents
There are two folders here:
1. unified-bubble-theory: the bubble dynamics model to simulate the bubble motion in different circumstances.
2. unified-bubble-theory-for-underwater-explosion: the complete code for the underwater explosion simulation, including the nearfield solver, farfield solver and the bubble solver.

The instructions for both can be found in the md file in each folder, respectively.
